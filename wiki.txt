This is a wiki file where problems I have encountered and how I have overcame them.

Problem : I could not run test by mvn -clean test.
Solution : maven-surefire-plugin should be 2.22.0 or higher for Junit-5 needed
Where I found : https://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/testing/junit-5-tutorial-running-unit-tests-with-maven/


Problem : Setting JAVA_HOME variable
Solution : Go to .zsh_profile and/or .bash_profile and set path as follows (path where u have installed Java) , save the file and restart the terminal
export JAVA_HOME=$(/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_281)
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

Problem : Running test methods in parallel
Solution : Setting properties in junit-platform-properties to have a parallel test
Note : Also this could be achieved in pom.xml file.
    Problem : Not able to run tests in parallel when @BeforeEach method is included in org.maksu.BaseTest.class
    Solution: Implemented @BeforeEach and @AfterEach methods for all test classes. But this is not a best practice since therw will be huge code multiplication when
              new test classes added to project.
        Result : @TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_METHOD) annotaion over BaseTest.class did it! Now  all test methods run in parallel.

Hint : You can also define junit config parameters in pom.xml as follows :
       https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-build-maven-config-params

Hint : You can get text of an input element by getAttribute("value").

Problem : I needed to read the email for "forgot-password" case.
Soluiton: Created a GmailInbox.class for that purpose
Found   : https://www.technicalkeeda.com/java-tutorials/how-to-access-gmail-inbox-using-java-imap
    Sub Problem : Parsing mail content
    Solution    : I used apache-commons-email for parsing emails.
    Found       : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11240368/how-to-read-text-inside-body-of-mail-using-javax-mail/31877854#






Important Notes concerning design!

- All tests methods should be independent and run randomly.
